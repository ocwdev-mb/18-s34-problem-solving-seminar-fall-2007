An English translation of a famous German classic. Develops the equivalent of a graduate level course in classical analysis (real and complex) based on problem solving. While many of the problems are too sophisticated for contests such as the Putnam Exam, there are still a large number of more accessible problems covering material almost impossible to learn otherwise.
